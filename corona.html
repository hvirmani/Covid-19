				<h3>Abstract:</h3>
				<p>Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are yet to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 27 to 34 kilobases, the largest among known RNA viruses. The name coronavirus is derived from the Latin corona,  which refers to the characteristic appearance reminiscent of a crown or a solar corona around the virions (virus particles).</p>

				<h3>Origin:</h3>
				<p>Many health experts belive that corona originated from bats or pangolins. The first transmission to humans was in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has mostly spread through person-to-person contact.
					Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause disease in both animals and humans. The <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome">(SARS)</abbr>virus strain known as SARS-CoV is an example of a coronavirus. SARS spread rapidly in 2002â€“2003.
					The new strain of coronavirus is called <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ">(SARS-CoV-2)</abbr>. The virus causes coronavirus (COVID-19).
                    Around 80% of people with COVID-19 recover without specialist treatment. These people may experience mild, flu-like symptoms. However, 1 in 6 people may experience severe symptoms, such as trouble in breathing.
					The new coronavirus has spread rapidly in many parts of the world. On March 11, 2020, the <abbr title="World Health Organization"> (WHO) </abbr> declared COVID-19 a pandemic. A pandemic occurs when a disease that people are not immune to spreads across large regions.
					Ever since the virus came to light in Wuhan in December last year, speculation has been rife on whether the viral strain originated from the <abbr title="Wuhan Institute of Virology"> (WIV) </abbr>or from its nearby Huanan Seafood Market.

				<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
				<p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case â€“ about as serious as a regular cold â€“ and recover without needing any special treatment.
About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.
					In the UK, the <abbr title="National health Service"> (NHS) </abbr>has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:
a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back a new continuous cough - this means youâ€™ve started coughing repeatedly
As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>

				<h3>Precautions:</h3>
				<p>1)Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Maintain at least three feet distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.<br>
				2)Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.<br>
                3)Stay home when you are sick.<br>
                4)Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then dispose of the tissue safely.<br>
					5)Quarantine in your homes.<a href=# target="_parent">Click This</a><br>
				6)Wearing a mask is not necessary unless you are taking care of an infected person. The <abbr title="Centers for Disease Control" > (CDC) </abbr> does recommend that only infected people wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus.<br>
				7)If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately.<br>
